## Introduction
APHunter is a Python-based tool developed for the identification of primers in amplicon sequencing data from `.fastq`, `.fq`, `.fastq.gz`, or `.fq.gz` files. It currently offers two operational versions: a "non-pool" mode and a "pool" mode, each tailored for different analytical scenarios. A detailed comparison between these modes can be found in the [Pool or Non-pool?](#pool-or-non-pool) section.

### Workflow
The core workflow of APHunter involves several key steps, with variations depending on the chosen mode:

#### Non-pool version
1.  **Reads Truncation:** All input reads are truncated to the first 100 base pairs using SeqKit.
2.  **Quality Filtering:** Low-quality reads are removed using VSEARCH, employing a maximum expected error (maxEE) threshold of 1.0.
3.  **Sample Filtering:** Samples with fewer than 1000 reads post-filtering are discarded.
4.  **Base Frequency Analysis:** For each remaining sample, the frequency of each nucleotide (A, T, C, G) at every base position across the truncated reads is calculated and visualized.
5.  **Consensus Sequence Generation:** A consensus sequence is derived for each sample based on the most frequent base (MFB) at each position. The consensus sequence is truncated when five consecutive MFBs exhibit a frequency below 0.75, indicating a potential transition into a less conserved region.
6.  **Primer Identification:** The generated consensus sequences are aligned against a primer database (e.g., an ITS primer database) using BLASTn-short. Significant matches identify potential primers used in the amplification.

#### Pool version
1.  **Sample Pooling:** All input samples are pooled into a single file.
2.  **Reads Truncation:** All reads in the pooled file are truncated to the first 100 base pairs using SeqKit.
3.  **Quality Filtering:** Low-quality reads are removed using VSEARCH, employing a maximum expected error (maxEE) threshold of 1.0.
4.  **Reads Clustering:** The filtered reads are clustered at a likelihood threshold of 0.9 using VSEARCH.
5.  **Cluster Filtering:** Clusters containing fewer than 0.05% of the total reads, or fewer than 100 reads (if 0.05% of total reads is less than 100), are discarded.
6.  **Base Frequency Analysis:** For each remaining cluster, the frequency of each nucleotide (A, T, C, G) at every base position across the reads within that cluster is calculated and visualized.
7.  **Consensus Sequence Generation:** A consensus sequence is derived for each cluster based on the MFB at each position. The consensus sequence is truncated when five consecutive MFBs exhibit a frequency below 0.75.
8.  **Primer Identification:** The consensus sequences from clusters are aligned against a primer database (e.g., an ITS primer database) using BLASTn-short to identify potential primers.

## User Manual
This section provides guidance on installing and using APHunter.

### Installation and Execution
APHunter is available on Anaconda and can be installed via the `westraingroup` channel:
```bash
conda install westraingroup::aphunter
```
It is recommended to install APHunter in a new conda environment, as this will automatically set up all required dependencies.

Once installed, APHunter can be run with the following basic command structure:
```bash
aphunter -i /your/input/directory -o /your/output/directory -s your_sample_file_suffix
```

### Parameters
The following table details the command-line parameters available for APHunter:

| Parameter               | Description                                                                                                                                                                |

### Pool or Non-pool?
Choosing between the pool and non-pool versions depends on your specific research question and dataset characteristics.

| Feature                             | Non-pool version                                                                                   | Pool version                                                                                                                                  |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Workflow Link                       | [View Non-pool Workflow](#non-pool-version)                                                        | [View Pool Workflow](#pool-version)                                                                                                           |
| Output Focus                        | Information and results are sample-specific.                                                       | Information and results are cluster-specific, derived from pooled data.                                                                       |
| Execution Speed                     | Generally faster for datasets with distinct sample compositions.                                   | Can be slower due to the comprehensive clustering step (please be patient ü•∫).                                                              |
| Interpretation of BLAST results     | Primer matches can be directly traced back to the specific samples in which they were detected.    | Primer matches are traced to read clusters and their relative abundance, indicating primers present across the pooled dataset.                |
| Primary Task                        | Ideal for identifying the most probable primer used in each individual sample.                     | Suited for identifying the range of primers present in a batch of samples, including detection of multiple primers if used (intentionally or not). |
| **Recommended Use Case**            | Precise, sample-level primer tracing; useful for detailed analysis and contamination tracking.     | High-throughput or batch sample analysis; efficient identification of primers across diverse clusters.                                      |

*This comparison is a guideline. We encourage users to experiment with both versions on their data and share their findings [with us](#contact) to help us further improve APHunter.*

### Understanding ITS Primer 'Siblings'
Due to sequence similarities, certain primers within the ITS primer database (or any comprehensive primer database) may be co-detected by BLAST. We term these "primer siblings." APHunter provides a pre-compiled list of such ITS primer groups to aid in result interpretation.

These groups were identified by an all-versus-all BLAST search within the ITS primer database. An alignment pair was considered significant if the alignment length was ‚â•15 base pairs with a percent identity >90% (resulting in an E-value < 1e-3).

**NOTE:** Primers are grouped if any primer in the group shares sufficient similarity with at least one other member of the same group. This means not all pairs within a group are necessarily highly similar to each other directly, but they are connected through a chain of similarity.

*   ITS1_1_fwd - ITS1ngs_1_fwd - ITS1Fngs_1_fwd - ITS1F_1_fwd - ITSOF-T_1_fwd - ITS1F_KYO1_1_fwd
*   58A1F_2_fwd - 58A2F_2_fwd - ITS3_2_fwd - 58A2R_1_rev - ITS2_1_rev
*   fITS7_2_fwd - gITS7_2_fwd - ITS86F_2_fwd - fITS7r_1_rev
*   ITS4_2_rev - ITS4-Fun_2_rev - ITS4ngs_2_rev
*   ITS9mun_1_fwd - ITS9MUNngs_1_fwd
*   ITS4_KYO2_2_rev - ITS4-Tul2_2_rev
*   ITS1-F_KYO2_1_fwd - ITS5_1_fwd
*   ITS4-Clav_2_rev - LR0B_2_rev
*   BITS_1_fwd - ITS1catta_1_fwd
*   ITS4B1_2_rev - ITS4B_2_rev
*   LR3_2_rev - TW13_2_rev

**Reminder:** When interpreting the results, there are four main senarios. You may refer to the following table to quickly identify the corresponding type of primer possibly used in your dataset:

| ITS region\Read orientation | Fwd (`_1` or `.1` input) | Rev (`_2` or `.2` input) |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **ITS1**                    | `_1_fwd` primers         | `_1_rev` primers         |
| **ITS2**                    | `_2_fwd` primers         | `_2_rev` primers         |

### Verifying Results (Optional)
To further validate primers identified by APHunter, users can employ tools like [Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to quantify the proportion of reads containing a specific primer sequence. This can provide an estimate of the primer's coverage in the raw or filtered dataset.

An example Cutadapt command (removing 5' end adapter) is:
```bash
cutadapt -g PRIMER_SEQ --minimum-length 1 --discard-untrimmed -o matched.fastq input.fastq > cutadapt.log
```
Put your 'suspect' primer into `PRIMER_SEQ`, adjust the error tolerance (`-e`, default is 0.1), input (`input.fastq`), and output (`-o matched.fastq`) parameters as needed.
